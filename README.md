# GitHub Stars Crawler (GitHub Actions + PostgreSQL)

This project automatically crawls GitHubâ€™s GraphQL API to collect **star counts across public repositories** and stores them in **PostgreSQL** during a **GitHub Actions workflow run**.

At the end of each run, the data is **exported as a CSV file**, which can be **downloaded directly from the GitHub Actions Artifacts panel** â€” **no local database or runtime setup required**.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

When the GitHub Actions workflow runs:

1. A **temporary PostgreSQL service** is started inside the GitHub runner

4. The CSV file is **uploaded as a downloadable GitHub Artifact**
